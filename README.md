#Air Passenger Traffic Analysis using Apache Spark

The python notebook containing code for the analysis in spark is attached.
The computation was done on the databricks cluster.

The data used in the analysis was downloaded from the [Bureau of Transportation Statistics website](http://www.transtats.bts.gov/DL_SelectFields.asp?Table_ID=236) and uploaded on Amazon S3 cluster. The s3 bucket was mounted on Databricks.
